- 👋 Hi, I’m Rosario (@rosariogdev) !
-✨ I started coding while learning a little HTML when making my own wordpress blogs/websites. The real learning however started while taking various software development courses during my college adventure.
- 🌱 I started learning the basics of Unix machines, C, C++, Web dev (HTML, XML, JSON, REST, Flask etc) and Python along backend solutions for data collection (REST, SQL, CouchDB) and visualization(NodeRed, Grapahana), networking (Wired and wireless networks) and communication (MQTT,Bacnet MSTP/IP, etc)
  related to IOT devices and Building Automation (HVAC monitoring systems, Smart Gardening system, Home Intrusion System), including some industrial automation (PLC Programming).
  -🐱‍🐉 Learned about VMs, Docker and the basics of Kubernetes
 -🤖I also had the chance to tinker with a fun machine learning/Artifical intelligence program using TensorFlow and a Raspberry Pi with a Picamera module!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I believe software has the potential to make every person's life easier and more efficient and productive. Donating time and effort to provide Open source
 software is a great way to help the world be a better place! So far, I have contributed to OSS Projects in the cryptocurrency space and really enjoyed it. If you have a project you would like some helping hands for, get my attention!
-🐱‍👤 I have tried to continuosly increase my knowledge in the languages I have learned about and have made a few home projects as a result.
-🐱‍🚀Working on obtaining all the freecodecamp certificates!
